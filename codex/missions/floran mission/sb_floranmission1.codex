"Following a distress signal on a nearby planet, I beamed down to what appeared to be a trap set by Floran hunters. I was cast into this tunnel system, carved deep beneath the surface. This is not a great start to the day.

Quickly I hid in a shallow pool, narrowly avoiding a passing rabble of hunters. I would say they were hunting for food, except they can get no nutrients from my metal body. They must hunt simply for the sport.",

"I believe my best chances to survive this unfortunate ordeal is to analyse and record the behaviours of my pursuers. I'm backing up my findings, so that if I do not survive, another may in my stead."
