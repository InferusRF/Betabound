"The Floran hunters seem to form groups - traps and settlements designed to catch their prey - in this case, me. They seemed to have also formed traps using a thick, green poisonous substance.

An interesting feature I've noticed is the remnants of old brick ruins here, interwined in the caverns. I theorise that this place was once governed by a different people - perhaps my fellow Glitch?",

"In my hiding, I stumbled upon a stone trench with a chest. Inside was some elaborate Floran clothing. Perhaps the hunters are rewarded for finding these? Either that, or someone stashed it here for safekeeping."
