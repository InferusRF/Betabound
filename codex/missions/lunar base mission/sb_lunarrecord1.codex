"I have been on this moon for three days now. The miners don't trust me, and rightly so: I'm ex-USCM, here to supervise this facility and keep everything above regulation. I've had to enforce the compulsory wearing of these high-vis jackets, something which hasn't won me any favours.

This moon is in a key spatial junction - Easily accessible from every sector of the galaxy. It's no surprise that a facility was built this soon after the discovery of the moon.",
    
"With a crew of less than fifty, this place feels smaller than other similar operations.

I've been deployed to similar moons when the USCM did these kinds of things, but I still can't shake that empty feeling I get when I look out the window, never to see the blue sky of a habitable planet. It adds to the overwhelming feeling I have deep down that man was not meant to live out here in the dark."
