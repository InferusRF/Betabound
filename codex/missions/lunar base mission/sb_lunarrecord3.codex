"There is something terribly wrong with this moon. The crew are disappearing. They aren't telling me anything, but I can just tell that there's going to be so much paperwork to do.",

"Everything has gone wrong. HQ has abandoned us. I've sent out a distress signal to tomorrow's crew, hopefully someone can come with backup. I'm sure there're some miners still stranded in the mines. There's nothing I can do for them now.

I'm going to lock down the facility - Close the entrance to the mine and turn off the power. Hopefully those things haven't made their way into the main building. Wish me luck."
