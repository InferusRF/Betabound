"The crew here mine for materials - Some crystal ore that is used to create warp drives.

To be honest, I am not concerned with the technical details - Science isn't my department. I'm more concerned with the wellbeing of the crew.

They took me on a complimentary tour of the mines today. I was glad to see everyone wearing their regulation safety helmets! Hopefully we'll have no accidents - The amount of paperwork involved would be stressful.",

"There were some strange noises coming from the mines when I visited. The crew assured me that it was probably just the machinery.

The glowing crystals made me feel quite sick - I'm surprised the crew haven't complained about it themselves."
