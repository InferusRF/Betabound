"I opened the door. The room was empty, save for a single chair, upon which sat the doll. I picked the thing up, and with a surge of anger, threw it on the ground and stomped on it. The plastic shattered beneath my foot.

As I glanced up, a shadow passed across the wall, and the door behind me slammed shut. I fumbled, trying to get out, and as I finally did so, I caught sight of a figure disappearing around the corner up ahead.",

"I followed the shadow all throughout the complex. It led me on a merry chase, always one step ahead. But finally, I caught up with it. It took a dead end; there was nowhere to hide. Now I wait outside of its sanctuary, building up my courage.

This ends now. I am a Glitch, I do not believe in souls nor spirits. I will prove this thing is flesh and blood, and if necessary, I will take it in.

Hewlett Deckard will not be toyed with.",
