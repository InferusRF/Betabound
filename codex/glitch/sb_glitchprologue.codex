"As one of the few Glitch to achieve self-awareness, I was forced to flee my home. With little preperation, no less. As a result, my ship has ran out of fuel in orbit of an unknown planet.

Being an outcast in unsympathetic territory is difficult. Being an outcast stuck in space, even more so, I find.",

"But with self-awareness comes new perspectives. I am no mere machine unable to see myself for what I am; I have the capability to act independently of my original programming, and I can get myself out of this mess. At least, in theory. It's time to find out just how useful 'organic thought' can be."
