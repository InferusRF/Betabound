"My Glitch contacts tell me of a creature lurking in the sewers. It is not found elsewhere, and as such poses an interesting question: how can we get hold of one so we can truly test its mettle? It is a giant fly, grown to epic proportions, and extremely aggressive in nature.

The Glitch tell me that it was created when a fly and a slightly larger fly got into a random teleportation accident, although this does not account for its huge size. Perhaps there is something in the water down there."
