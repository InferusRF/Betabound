"Dearest Hylotl missionary,
You have ventured out into the unforgiving universe to spread word of our species and to help all those in need. For this, we thank you.

May the Hylotl spread peace throughout the universe. Be discerning, polite, and remember ^red;Directive 0451^reset;. If you do not remember what ^red;Directive 0451^reset; is, then do not worry about it. Or ask about it. Or think about it. Just do your job, okay?"
