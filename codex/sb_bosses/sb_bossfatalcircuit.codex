"An outcast Glitch, desperate to strengthen their numbers, came up with a plan. Outcast leader Platinum Ace approached a particularly volatile Glitch scientist, and together they drew up blueprints for a new form of Glitch; a better, more powerful being.

Thus, the first Fatal Circuit was born. Initially, everything was okay. Then two seconds passed and Fatal Circuit malfunctioned, trying to kill every living being in the immediate area.",

"After a lengthy chase, Platinum smashed Fatal Circuit with a handy nearby hammer, and inspected the wreckage. She was horrified to discover that the scientist had transplanted a monster brain into the robot, thus rendering it uncontrollably murderous.

Deciding Fatal Circuit should never be recreated, Platinum buried the plans in a landfill in the desert, but recent sightings have suggested that someone has found the Fatal Circuit blueprint."
//,"Fun Fatal Circuit Fact: Big Ape and the Rogue Greenfinger once tried to improve the design by using a Floran brain, but for some reason the robot was just as savage and uncontrollable."
