"While it is the case that I may have escaped for my own self-preservation, it is important I do not forget my larger mission also. Kluex is not real. I will prove it. If I can do this, I can free my people.

I have heard of other species whose gods are celestial. Kluex, however, is flesh and blood. And yet, he has not been seen for many, many years. I will discover why. I will uncover the secret behind the Kluex deception. But I will also flee for my own life."
