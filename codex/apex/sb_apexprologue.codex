"The Miniknog has crushed our portion of the Apex Rebellion. My friends, family, everything I've known... I escaped with my life intact by hijacking a Miniknog ship, but it has ran out of fuel in orbit of an unknown planet.
    
Gunfire, screaming Apex, squelching bananas... These sounds still ring in my ears, but I am free. Free, and floating in space. I have decided it is probably time to do something about that latter half. If I encounter any Miniknog, well... This time, I'm going ape."
